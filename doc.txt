Title:

Medical Diagnosis Classifier Using AI and the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset

Context: We aim to solve a medical diagnosis problem: predicting whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on key health indicators.
 We use the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset (UCI Repository), which includes:

Pregnancies, Glucose, BMI, Age

Blood Pressure, Insulin levels, Skin Thickness

Purpose: To build a machine learning-based system that predicts diabetes risk and enhances user interaction through a conversational AI chatbot, making diagnosis more accessible and intuitive.


Outcome
 Accepts patient health data, Returns prediction: Diabetic (1) or Not Diabetic (0), Provides confidence scores, Offers AI-powered explanations in natural language.

Approach:

Use the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset, which contains health records (e.g., glucose levels, BMI, pregnancies).

Preprocess and train a classification model (e.g., logistic regression or random forest) using sklearn.

Integrate a conversational AI (via Claude API) to parse user input and explain results.

Example: A user types "Iâ€™m 45 years old, BMI of 32, glucose 140", and the assistant interprets, predicts, and gives a meaningful response.

Tools & Technologies:

Python (for model development)

Scikit-learn (ML algorithms & metrics)

Pandas & NumPy (data preprocessing)

Claude for Chatbot interface (natural language interaction)

Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit / Flask (for demonstration)

Possible Challenges:

Ensuring the model is accurate and not biased by dataset limitations.

Handling vague or incomplete user input in natural language.

Ensuring ethical use and understanding limitations of AI in healthcare.
